Welcome to the Long Beach Nonprofit Guide! This guide details the steps that I took to establish a 501c3 nonprofit organization in Long Beach, California. The organization characteristics made the process relatively straightforward in that it was organized as a charitable organization public benefit corporation, there were no members, no employees, and no physical assets. That being said, the process of taking an unincorporated group of individuals and turning it into a legally recognized nonprofit organization was still complex and time-consuming. This guide is intended to document the steps that I took in the hopes that it will be helpful to others who are considering starting similar nonprofit organization in Long Beach or elsewhere.
