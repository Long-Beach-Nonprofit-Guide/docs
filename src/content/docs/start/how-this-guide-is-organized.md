This guide represents the step-by-step process that I took to not only establish a 501c3 nonprofit organization, but also to establish the necessary infrastructure to make the organization operational. The order of the steps was influenced by the filing requirements of the IRS and California state agencies, as well as some of the practical considerations that I encountered along the way that ensured that the organization was set up for success.

Each step section includes a brief overview of the task, a list of resources, a description of the steps that I followed, the results of the completed tasks and a cost breakdown. In some cases, I have included links to external resources that I found helpful in completing the task.
