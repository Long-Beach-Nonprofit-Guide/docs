This guide represents the step-by-step process that I took to not only establish a 501c3 nonprofit organization, but also to establish the necessary infrastructure to make the organization operational. Each step in the process is documented in a separate document, which is linked in the table of contents below. The order of the steps was influenced by the filing requirements of the IRS and California state agencies, as well as some of the practical considerations that I encountered along the way that ensured that the organization was set up for success.

Each step section includes a brief overview of the task, a list of resources, a description of the process that I followed, the outcomes of the completed task and a cost breakdown. In some cases, I have included links to external resources that I found helpful in completing the task. I have also included some tips and recommendations based on my experience, as well as some potential pitfalls to avoid.
