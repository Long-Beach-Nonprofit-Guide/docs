In addition to filing for federal tax-exempt status with the IRS, nonprofit organizations in California must also file for state tax exemption with the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB). This process is separate from the federal filing and requires the completion of form FTB 3500A, Exemption Application. Once the organization has been granted state tax-exempt status, it will be exempt from paying California state income tax on its income.
