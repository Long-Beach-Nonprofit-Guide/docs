It is important to choose an organization name early in the process of starting a nonprofit. The name you choose will be the public
face of your organization and will be used in all of your communications over the course of the application process.

<Aside>
The name needs to be approved by the California Secretary of State and the IRS, so it was important to choose a name that would meet their requirements.

### Tasks

<Steps>

1. **Brainstorm names:** I started by brainstorming a list of potential names for the organization. I wanted to choose a name that was unique, descriptive, and memorable, and that would resonate with the organization's target audience. I also wanted to choose a name that would be easy to spell and pronounce, and that would be available as a domain name.

1. **Check availability:** Once I had a list of potential names, I checked the availability of each name to make sure that it was not already in use by another organization. I used the IRS Exempt Organizations Select Check tool to search for tax-exempt organizations with similar names, and the California Secretary of State Business Search tool to search for business entities with similar names.

1. **Reserve name:** Once I had chosen a name that was available, I reserved the name with the California Secretary of State. This involved submitting a Name Reservation Request form and paying a fee. The name reservation was valid for 60 days, during which time I needed to file the articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State. I wanted to reserve the name first so that I could draft the organization documents with the name in mind, and get them approved by the board during the initial board meeting **before** filing the articles of incorporation. This would ensure that the name was approved by the board and that I would not have to amend the articles of incorporation later.

### Result

An available name for the organization that is reserved with the California Secretary of State.
