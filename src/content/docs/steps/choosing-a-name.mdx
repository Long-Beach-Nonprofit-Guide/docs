It is important to choose an organization name early in the process of starting a nonprofit. The name you choose will be the public face of your organization and will be used in all of your communications over the course of the application process.

### Tasks

<Steps>

    1. **Brainstorm names:** Brainstormed a list of potential names for the organization. The name should be unique, descriptive, easy to remember, and reflect the mission and values of the organization.

    1. **Check availability:** Check the availability of the names on the California Secretary of State's [Business Search](https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/search/business) website. The name should not be the same as or too similar to an existing organization, and should not contain certain restricted words or phrases. See the [Name Regulations, Requirements & Restrictions](https://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/business-entities/name-reservations) for more information.

    1. **Reserve name:** Reserve the name with the California Secretary of State by filing a [Name Reservation - Corporation Form](https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/forms/business). This will prevent other organizations from using the name while the application process is underway. The is especially important in the beginning of the process before any documents are filed to ensure that the name is available. Reserving the name also allows the board to approve the name before it is officially filed with the state at the initial board meeting to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
