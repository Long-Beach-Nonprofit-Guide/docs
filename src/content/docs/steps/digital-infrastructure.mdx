It is also important to establish the initial digital infrastructure for the organization at the beginning of the 501(c)(3) application process. 
This includes a domain name, business email addresses, and a digital workspace. This will help the organization to establish a professional online 
presence, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and collaborate on projects. It is especially important for the application process to have a
professional email address and phone number for the organization so that all organizationâ€™s communications and documents were in one place and could
be easily accessed and shared with the board and other stakeholders.

### Tasks

<Steps>

1. **Choose a domain name:** I started by choosing a domain name for the organization. The domain name would be used to identify the organization online, and would be used in the organization's website, email addresses, and other digital communications. I wanted to choose a domain name that was easy to remember, easy to spell, and that would be available for registration. I also wanted to choose a domain name that was descriptive of the organization's mission and that would resonate with the organization's target audience.

1. **Check availability:** Once I had chosen a domain name, I checked the availability of the domain name to make sure that it was not already in use by another organization. I used a domain registrar like [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/) to search for the domain name and see if it was available for registration.

1. **Google Workspace:** Once I had a domain name, I signed up for Google Workspace. One of the benefits of the Google Workspace sign up process is that it includes domain purchase/registration. This made it easy to set up business email addresses using the organization's domain name. Google Workspace also provides a suite of tools for collaboration and communication, including Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Google Meet. I chose Google Workspace because it was affordable, easy to use, and provided the tools that I needed to get the organization up and running quickly. Not only that, but it's also free for nonprofits through the Google for Nonprofits program! So once I had the 501c3 determination letter from the IRS, I could apply for the Google for Nonprofits program and get Google Workspace for free.

1. **Google Voice:** I also signed up for Google Voice, which is a virtual phone service that provides a phone number that can be used for business calls and text messages. Google Voice integrates with Google Workspace, so I was able to set up a business phone number that was linked to the organization's email addresses. This made it easy to manage business communications and keep everything in one place. Google Voice is also relatively inexpensive, and provides a lot of features that are useful for small organizations, like call forwarding, voicemail transcription, and text messaging.
