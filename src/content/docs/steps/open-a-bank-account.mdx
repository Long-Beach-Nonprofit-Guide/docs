Once you have the Employer Identification Number (EIN), the next step was to open a bank account for the organization. The bank account is used to 
manage the organization's finances, including receiving donations, paying bills, and tracking expenses. Having a separate bank account for the organization 
is important for maintaining good financial records and ensuring that the organization's funds are kept separate from personal funds.

### Duration

- 1 day

### Tasks

<Steps>

1. **Choose a bank**: The first step in opening a bank account is to choose a bank that meets the needs of the organization. I chose to open an account with BlueVine because they offer free business checking accounts with no monthly fees, no minimum balance requirements, and no transaction fees. I also liked that they offer online account management and integration with accounting software like QuickBooks. Additionally, I did not need to wait to obtain 501c3 status from the IRS to open an account with BlueVine. This was important to me because I wanted to get the account opened as soon as possible so that I could start using it for the organization's expenses.

1. **Gather required documents**: BlueVine outlines the necessary information to open an account on their website. The information that I needed to provide included:
    - Business information (name, address, phone number)
    - Industry type
    - Tax EIN
    - Annual revenue
    - Personal information (name, address, phone number)
    - Date of birth and Social Security number
    - Photo ID
    - Ownership percentage
    - Business formation documents (articles of incorporation, bylaws, etc.)

1. **Apply online**: I applied for the account online through the BlueVine website.
