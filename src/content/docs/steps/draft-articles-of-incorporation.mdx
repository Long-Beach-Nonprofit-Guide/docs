Before starting the process of actually applying for 501(c)(3) status, the organization will need to be legally established as a corporation. Although
the process of incorporating in California is relatively straightforward, there are accompanying organizational documents that need to be drafted and
approved by the board of directors before filing to incorporate with the California Secretary of State. One of these organizational documents is the
articles of incorporation, which is a legal document that establishes the corporation as a legal entity and outlines the purpose of the corporation, the
powers of the corporation, and the initial board of directors.
