The agent for service of process is an individual or entity that is designated to receive legal documents on behalf of the organization. The agent for service of process is responsible for receiving legal documents, such as lawsuits and other legal notices, and ensuring that they are delivered to the appropriate individuals within the organization. The agent for service of process is a critical role in the organization, as they are responsible for ensuring that the organization is aware of any legal actions that are being taken against it and that the organization is able to respond in a timely manner.

The agent for service of process can be an individual, such as an officer or director of the organization, or it can be a professional service provider, such as a registered agent service. Some of the benefits of using a registered agent service are that it provides an added layer of privacy and security for the organization, as the registered agent's address is used in place of the organization's address on legal documents, and nonprofit administrators can avoid having to update the agent's address if they move or change locations when using a registered agent service.
