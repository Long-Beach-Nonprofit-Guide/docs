Finally, the time has come to file for 501c3 status with the IRS. This is the last major step in the process of establishing a nonprofit organization. Once the organization has been granted 501c3 status, it will be eligible to receive tax-deductible donations and apply for grants from foundations and government agencies. This step is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the organization, as it will allow the organization to raise funds to support its mission.

### Tasks

<Steps>

1. **Prepare the application**: The first step in filing for 501c3 status is to prepare the application. There are two forms that can be used to apply for 501c3 status: Form 1023-EZ and Form 1023. Form 1023-EZ is a streamlined application for organizations with gross receipts of $50,000 or less and assets of $250,000 or less. Form 1023 is a longer and more detailed application that must be completed by organizations that do not qualify to use Form 1023-EZ. I chose to use Form 1023-EZ because the organization's gross receipts and assets were below the thresholds for using this form.

1. **Submit the application**: Once the application is complete, it must be submitted to the IRS along with the appropriate fee. The fee for filing Form 1023-EZ is $275, while the fee for filing Form 1023 is $600. The application can be submitted online through the IRS website, or it can be mailed to the IRS. I chose to submit the application online because it was faster and more convenient.

1. **Wait for a determination**: After the application has been submitted, the organization must wait for the IRS to review the application and make a determination on its 501c3 status. The IRS aims to process Form 1023-EZ applications within 2-4 weeks, while Form 1023 applications can take 3-6 months or longer to process. Once the organization has been granted 501c3 status, it will receive a determination letter from the IRS confirming its tax-exempt status.

### Result

501c3 status granted by the IRS. The organization is now eligible to receive tax-deductible donations and apply for grants from foundations and government agencies.
