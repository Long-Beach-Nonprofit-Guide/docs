In order to operate legally within the City of Long Beach, nonprofit organizations are required to obtain a business license from the city. The business license is a tax that is imposed on businesses operating within the city limits and is used to fund city services and programs. The business license tax is based on the gross receipts of the organization and is due annually. However, nonprofit organizations that have received 501(c)(3) status from the IRS are eligible for an exemption from the business license tax.

### Tasks

<Steps>

    1. **Determine the type of business license**: The first step in obtaining a business license is to determine the type of license that is required for your organization. The City of Long Beach offers several different types of business licenses, depending on the type of business and the location of the business. For the purposes of a nonprofit organization, you will likely need a general business license.

    1. **Complete the application**: Once you have determined the type of license that is required, you will need to complete the business license application. The application requires information about the organization, including its name, address, purpose, and activities.

    1. **Complete the exemption form**: If your organization has received 501(c)(3) status from the IRS, you are eligible for an exemption from the business license tax. In order to claim the exemption, you will need to complete an exemption form and submit it along with the business license application.

    1. **Submit the application**: Once the application and exemption form have been completed, you will need to submit them to the City of Long Beach. The application can be submitted online or in person at the city's business license office.

    1. **Wait for approval**: After the application has been submitted, the city will review the application and determine whether the organization is eligible for a business license. If the application is approved, the organization will receive a business license from the city.
