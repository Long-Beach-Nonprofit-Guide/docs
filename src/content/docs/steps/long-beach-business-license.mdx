In order to operate legally within the City of Long Beach, nonprofit organizations are required to obtain a business license from the city. The business license 
is a tax that is imposed on businesses operating within the city limits and is used to fund city services and programs. The business license tax is based on the 
gross receipts of the organization and is due annually. However, nonprofit organizations that have received 501c3 status from the IRS are eligible for an exemption
from the business license tax.

### Duration

- 1 day

### Tasks

<Steps>

1. **Determine the type of business license**: The first step in obtaining a business license is to determine the type of license that is required for your organization. The City of Long Beach offers several different types of business licenses, depending on the type of business and the location of the business. For the purposes of a nonprofit organization, you will likely need a general business license.

1. **Complete the application**: Once you have determined the type of license that is required, you will need to complete the business license application. The application requires information about the organization, including its name, address, purpose, and activities.

1. **Complete the exemption form**: Since I had received my 501c3 determination letter from the IRS, I was eligible for an exemption from the business license tax. To apply for the exemption, I had to complete an exemption form and include it, along with other supporting documentation, with my business license application.

1. **Submit the application**: After completing the application and exemption form, I submitted them to the City of Long Beach.

1. **Wait for approval**: After submitting the application, I had to wait for the City of Long Beach to review the application and make a determination on the business license and exemption. Once the application was approved, I received a business license from the city.
