The initial board meeting is an important milestone in the process of establishing a nonprofit organization. At the initial board meeting, the board of directors will review and approve the organization's bylaws, articles of incorporation, and other organizational documents. The board will also adopt resolutions to approve the organizational documents and authorize the officers to take certain actions on behalf of the organization, such as filing the articles of incorporation with the California Secretary of State and applying for 501(c)(3) status with the IRS. The meeting minutes will be recorded and signed by the board members, and the resolutions will be adopted. This is a critical step in the process of establishing a nonprofit organization, as it ensures that all stakeholders are on the same page before starting the process for actually applying for 501(c)(3) status with the IRS.
