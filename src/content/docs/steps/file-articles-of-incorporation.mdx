Once all of the organizational documents have been drafted and approved by the board of directors, the next step is to file the articles of incorporation with the California Secretary of State. The articles of incorporation are a legal document that establishes the organization as a corporation and outlines the purpose of the corporation, the powers of the corporation, and the initial board of directors.

### Tasks

<Steps>

    1. **Create an account:** The first step is to create an account on the California Secretary of State's website. This will allow you to access the online filing system and submit the articles of incorporation.

    1. **Complete the form:** The next step is to complete the articles of incorporation form. The form requires basic information about the organization, such as its name, purpose, and address. You will also need to provide the names and addresses of the initial directors of the organization.

    1. **Pay the filing and certified copy fee:** There is a filing fee associated with filing the articles of incorporation. You should also pay for a certified copy of the articles to keep for your records as you will need this document to apply for 501(c)(3) status with the IRS.

    1. **Submit the form:** Once you have completed the form and paid the filing fee, you can submit the articles of incorporation online.

    1. **Wait for confirmation:** After the articles of incorporation have been submitted, you will need to wait for confirmation from the California Secretary of State that the articles have been accepted and processed.
