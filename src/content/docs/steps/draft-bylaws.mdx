The bylaws are the second of the two key organizational documents that need to be drafted and approved by the board of directors before filing to incorporate 
with the California Secretary of State. The bylaws are the rules and procedures that govern the internal operations of the organization, including the roles and 
responsibilities of the board of directors and officers, the process for holding meetings, and the process for making decisions. The bylaws are an important 
document that helps ensure that the organization operates effectively and efficiently and that the board of directors and officers understand their roles and 
responsibilities.

For example, one of the requirements of a nonprofit public benefit corporation in California is that the organization have at least three officers: a president,
a secretary, and a treasurer. The bylaws should outline the roles and responsibilities of each officer, including the duties of the president, the duties of the
secretary, and the duties of the treasurer. This is especially helpful in order to determine who is responsible for filing necessary reports with the state and
federal government to maintain the organization's tax-exempt status.
