title: Budget
---

The budget for starting a nonprofit organization can vary depending on the complexity of the organization and the state in which it is being formed. This guide is intended for relatively simple public charities that are being formed in California and so the budget provided here reflects that.

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Entity Name Reservation | $10 |
| Articles of Incorporation Filing Fee | $30 |
| Certified Copy of Articles of Incorporation | $5 |
| Form 1023-EZ/1023 Filing Fee | $275/$600 |
| Form SI-100 Filing Fee | $20 |
| Form CT-1 Filing Fee | $50 |
| **Total** | **$390/$715** |

As you can see, the cost of starting a nonprofit organization can be relatively low. However, it is important to be prepared for potential additional costs in the process as well as ongoing costs associated with maintaining the organization such as annual filing fees and other administrative costs. Refer to the [IRS Charities and Nonprofits](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits) and the [California Secretary of State: Forms, Samples and Fees](https://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/business-entities/forms) websites for the most up-to-date information on fees and costs associated with starting and maintaining a nonprofit organization.
