There were a few prerequisites that I wanted to decided on before I could move forward with the process of establishing a nonprofit organization. The first of these was choosing a name for the organization. The name that I chose would be used to identify the organization in all of its official documents, communications, and branding. It was important to choose a name that was unique, descriptive, and memorable, and that would resonate with the organization's target audience. The name would also need to be approved by the California Secretary of State and the IRS, so it was important to choose a name that would meet their requirements.

### Steps

<Steps>

1. **Brainstorm names:** I started by brainstorming a list of potential names for the organization. I wanted to choose a name that was unique, descriptive, and memorable, and that would resonate with the organization's target audience. I also wanted to choose a name that would be easy to spell and pronounce, and that would be available as a domain name.

1. **Check availability:** Once I had a list of potential names, I checked the availability of each name to make sure that it was not already in use by another organization. I used the IRS Exempt Organizations Select Check tool to search for tax-exempt organizations with similar names, and the California Secretary of State Business Search tool to search for business entities with similar names.

1. **Reserve name:** Once I had chosen a name that was available, I reserved the name with the California Secretary of State. This involved submitting a Name Reservation Request form and paying a fee. The name reservation was valid for 60 days, during which time I needed to file the articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State. I wanted to reserve the name first so that I could draft the organization documents with the name in mind, and get them approved by the board during the initial board meeting **before** filing the articles of incorporation. This would ensure that the name was approved by the board and that I would not have to amend the articles of incorporation later.

### Result

An available name for the organization that is reserved with the California Secretary of State.
