Once the articles of incorporation have been filed with the California Secretary of State, the next step is to apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The EIN is a unique nine-digit number that is assigned to a business entity for tax filing and reporting purposes. The EIN is used to identify the organization to the IRS and other federal agencies, and is required for a variety of purposes, including opening a bank account, applying for tax-exempt status, and filing tax returns.

### Steps

<Steps>

1. **Gather required information**: Before starting the application process, make sure you have all of the required information on hand. This includes the legal name of the organization, the address of the organization, the name and address of the responsible party, and the type of entity (e.g. corporation, partnership, etc.).

1. **Complete the online application**: The fastest and easiest way to apply for an EIN is to complete the online application on the IRS website. The application is free and can be completed in a matter of minutes. Once you have submitted the application, you will receive your EIN immediately.

1. **Save your EIN confirmation letter**: After you have received your EIN, be sure to save the confirmation letter that the IRS sends you. This letter contains your EIN and should be kept in a safe place for future reference. I suggest uploading a copy of the letter to your organization's Google Drive for easy access.
