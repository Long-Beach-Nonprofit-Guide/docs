After I received my 501c3 determination letter from the IRS, the next step was to obtain a business license from the City of Long Beach. This license is required for all businesses operating within the city limits, including nonprofit organizations. The business license is used to track businesses operating in the city and to ensure compliance with local regulations.

Additionally, you can apply for an exemption from the business license tax if your organization meets certain criteria. For example, charitable organizations that are exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are eligible for an exemption from the business license tax.

The City of Long Beach offers several different types of business licenses, depending on the type of business and the location of the business. For the purposes of a nonprofit organization, you will likely need a general business license.

1. **Complete the exemption form**: Since I had received my 501c3 determination letter from the IRS, I was eligible for an exemption from the business license tax. To apply for the exemption, I had to complete an exemption form and include it, along with other supporting documentation, with my business license application.

1. **Submit the application**: After completing the application and exemption form, I submitted them to the City of Long Beach.

1. **Wait for approval**: After submitting the application, I had to wait for the City of Long Beach to review the application and make a determination on the business license and exemption. Once the application was approved, I received a business license from the city.
