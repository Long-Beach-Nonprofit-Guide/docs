The timeline for starting a nonprofit organization can vary depending on the complexity of the organization and the state in which it is being formed. This guide is intended for relatively simple public charities that are being formed in California. Therefore, the timeline provided here is a general estimate and may not apply to all organizations.

| Step| Task | Timeframe |
|-----|------|-----------|
|  1  | **Draft Articles of Incorporation** | 2 days |
|  2  | **Draft Bylaws** | 3 days |
|  3  | **Initial Board Meeting** | 1 day |
|  4  | **File Articles of Incorporation** | 1 day |
|  5  | **Apply for EIN** | 1 day |
|  6  | **File for 501(c)(3) status** | 1 day |
|  7  | **Wait for IRS determination** | 1 month |
|  8  | **File for state tax exemption** | 1 day |
|  9  | **Wait for state determination** | 1 month |
|  10  | **File Statement of Information** | 1 day |
|  11  | **Register with Registry of Charitable Trusts** | 1 day |
|  12  | **Apply for Long Beach Business License** | 1 day |

As you can see, the process of starting a nonprofit organization can be completed in a couple of months. However, the timeline above does not take into account the processing times of the various government agencies involved in the process. Therefore, it is important to be prepared for potential delays in the process. Refer to the [Current State Processing Times](https://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/business-entities/processing-dates) for the most up-to-date information on state processing times, and the [Where's My Exemption Application?](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/wheres-my-application-for-tax-exempt-status) publication for information on IRS processing times.
