# File statement of information with California Secretary of State

## Overview

After I filed for tax exemption at the state (California Franchise Tax Board) and federal (IRS) levels, the next step was to file a statement of information with the California Secretary of State. This filing is required for all corporations, including nonprofit organizations, and must be completed within 90 days of filing the articles of incorporation. The statement of information provides the state with updated information about the organization, including the names and addresses of the officers, directors, and agent for service of process.
