# Draft bylaws

## Overview

The bylaws are the rules and regulations that govern the internal operations of the organization. They are adopted by the board of directors and outline the structure, powers, and responsibilities of the board and officers. The bylaws also establish the procedures for holding meetings, electing directors, and making decisions. They are an important document that helps ensure that the organization operates in a transparent, accountable, and effective manner. Once I had drafted the articles of incorporation, the next step was to prepare a draft of the bylaws for approval by the board at the initial board meeting.

## Process

I pulled heavily from the Public Counsel template to draft the bylaws for the organization. The template provided a comprehensive set of bylaws that covered all of the key provisions that I wanted to include along with annotations that explained the purpose and rationale behind each provision.

One of the only sections that I wanted to expand on in the bylaws was the roles and responsibilities of the organization's officers. California law requires that a nonprofit public benefit corporation have at least three officers: a president, a secretary, and a treasurer. This is a requirement when filing the ongoing compliance Statement of Information document with the California Secretary of State. Since I wasn't going to be a part of the organization long-term, I wanted to ensure that the bylaws were clear about which officers were responsible for which tasks to maintain the organization's compliance. If the board decided to add additional officers in the future, or change the responsibilities of the existing officers, the bylaws would need to be amended accordingly.
