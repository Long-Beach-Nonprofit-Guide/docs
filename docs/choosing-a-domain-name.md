# Choosing a domain name

Choosing a domain name for your organization is an important step in establishing your online presence. Your domain name is the address that people will use to find your website, so it should be easy to remember, easy to spell, and reflective of your organization's mission and purpose. A well-chosen domain name can help you attract visitors to your website, build brand recognition, and establish credibility with your audience.

## Why is choosing a domain name important?

Choosing a domain name for your organization is important for several reasons:

1. **Unlocks digital infrastructure:** Choosing a domain name is the first step in setting up your organization's digital infrastructure. Once you have a domain name, you can create business email addresses, set up a website, and establish other online tools and resources. Business email addresses are especially important during the application process for 501c3 status to ensure that communication is professional, consistent and secure.

2. **Establishes your online identity:** Your domain name is the first thing people will see when they visit your website. It is an important part of your organization's online identity and can help people understand who you are and what you do.

3. **Builds brand recognition:** A domain name that is clear, concise, and easy to remember can help build brand recognition and make it easier for people to find and remember your website.

4. **Improves search engine visibility:** A domain name that includes relevant keywords can help improve your website's search engine visibility and make it easier for people to find your website through search engines like Google.

5. **Establishes credibility:** A professional-looking domain name can help establish credibility and trust with your audience. It can make your organization appear more legitimate and professional, which can help build confidence in your organization.

6. **Differentiates your organization:** A unique domain name can help differentiate your organization from others in the same space. It can help you stand out and make it easier for people to remember and recognize your website.

## How to choose a domain name for your organization

Choosing a domain name for your organization involves several key steps:

1. **Define your organization's mission:** Start by defining your organization's mission and purpose. What problem are you trying to solve? What impact do you want to have on the community or the world? Your domain name should reflect these goals and objectives.

2. **Brainstorm ideas:** Brainstorm a list of potential domain names for your organization. Consider names that reflect your mission, are easy to remember, and are unique. Avoid names that are too long, difficult to spell, or similar to other organizations in your space.

3. **Check availability:** Once you have a list of potential domain names, check to see if they are available. You can do this by searching online through domain registrars like GoDaddy or Namecheap. Make sure that the domain name you choose is not already in use by another organization and that it is not trademarked.

4. **Choose a domain extension:** A domain extension is the suffix at the end of a domain name, such as .com, .org, or .net. Choose a domain extension that best reflects the nature of your organization. For example, if you are a nonprofit organization, you may want to choose a .org extension.

5. **Get feedback:** Once you have narrowed down your list of potential domain names, get feedback from your team, volunteers, and stakeholders. Ask them what they think of the names and whether they accurately reflect your organization's mission and purpose.

6. **Register your domain name:** Once you have chosen a domain name for your organization, you should register it with a domain registrar. This will give you exclusive rights to use the domain name and will prevent other organizations from using the same name. You can register your domain name for a small fee, usually on an annual basis.
