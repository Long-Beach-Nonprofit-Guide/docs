# Choosing a domain name

It is important to choose a domain name **before** you start the process of establishing your organization. The domain name you choose will be an important part of your organization's online identity and will be used in all of your online communications and branding efforts. You should check to ensure that the domain name you choose is not already in use by another organization. You can use the following resources to check the availability of a domain name:

- **Domain name registrars:** You can search for available domain names using a domain name registrar like [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), or [Google Domains](https://domains.google/). These services allow you to search for available domain names and register them for a fee.

- **WHOIS database:** You can search the WHOIS database to see if the domain name you want is already registered by another organization. You can search the database [here](https://whois.icann.org/en).

Once you have chosen a name for your nonprofit organization, you should consider registering a domain name that matches your organization's name. A domain name is the address that people use to access your organization's website on the internet. It is important to choose a domain name that is easy to remember, easy to spell, and reflects the mission and purpose of your organization.

When choosing a domain name for your organization, you should consider the following tips:

- **Make it match your organization's name:** Choose a domain name that matches your organization's name as closely as possible. This will help people remember your organization's website address and find it easily online.

- **Make it easy to spell and pronounce:** Choose a domain name that is easy to spell and pronounce. This will make it easier for people to remember and type your organization's website address.

- **Make it descriptive:** Choose a domain name that reflects the mission and purpose of your organization. A descriptive domain name can help potential donors and supporters understand what your organization does.
