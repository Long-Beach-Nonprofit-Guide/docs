# File articles of incorporation

The articles of incorporation are a legal document that establishes your organization as a corporation. The articles of incorporation outline key information about your organization, such as its name, purpose, and structure. Filing the articles of incorporation is an important step in the process of incorporating your organization and obtaining 501c3 status.

## Why are the articles of incorporation important?

The articles of incorporation are important for several reasons:

1. **Establish legal status:** The articles of incorporation establish your organization as a legal entity. By filing the articles of incorporation, you create a separate legal entity that can enter into contracts, own property, and conduct business in its own name.

2. **Define organizational structure:** The articles of incorporation define the structure of your organization, including its name, purpose, and structure. They outline the roles and responsibilities of the board of directors, officers, and members, and provide a framework for how the organization will be governed and operated.

3. **Establish tax-exempt status:** Filing the articles of incorporation is a key step in obtaining 501c3 status. The articles of incorporation must include specific language required by the IRS to qualify for tax-exempt status, such as a statement of purpose and dissolution clause.

4. **Protect the organization:** The articles of incorporation protect the organization and its members by establishing clear rules and regulations for how the organization will be governed and operated. They provide a basis for resolving disputes and conflicts and help ensure that the organization operates in the best interests of its stakeholders.

5. **Facilitate fundraising:** The articles of incorporation are often required by funders and donors as part of the grant application process. Having well-drafted articles of incorporation can help build credibility with funders and donors and demonstrate that the organization is well-governed and accountable.

## How to file the articles of incorporation for your organization

Filing the articles of incorporation for your organization involves several key steps:

1. **Choose a name for your organization:** The first step in filing the articles of incorporation is to choose a name for your organization. The name you choose should be unique, easy to remember, and reflective of your organization's mission and purpose. You should also check to make sure that the name is available and not already in use by another organization.

2. **Define the purpose of your organization:** Define the purpose and activities of your organization in clear and concise terms. Your articles of incorporation should clearly state the mission and goals of the organization and outline the activities it will engage in to achieve those goals.

3. **Outline the structure of your organization:** Outline the structure of your organization, including the roles and responsibilities of its officers, directors, and members. Your articles of incorporation should specify how the organization will be governed, how decisions will be made, and how conflicts will be resolved.

4. **Include required legal language:** The articles of incorporation must include certain legal language required by the state in which the organization is formed. This language typically includes the name of the organization, its purpose, its duration, and other key information required by state law.

5. **File the articles of incorporation:** Once you have drafted the articles of incorporation, you will need to file them with the state in which the organization is formed. This typically involves submitting the articles of incorporation to the state's business registration office along with a filing fee. Once the articles of incorporation are filed, the organization will be legally established as a corporation.
