# What is a 501c3?

A 501c3 is a type of tax-exempt organization that is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as being organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and preventing cruelty to children or animals.[^1]

501c3 organizations are exempt from federal income tax and are eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions from donors.[^2] This status is highly sought after by nonprofit organizations, as it provides significant financial benefits and credibility in the eyes of donors and the public.

There are different types of 501c3 organizations, including charitable organizations, private foundations, and churches and religious organizations. Each type has its own set of rules and requirements for maintaining tax-exempt status.

This guide focuses on charitable organizations that are organized as public benefit corporations in California. A public benefit corporation is a type of nonprofit organization that is organized and operated for the benefit of any public or charitable purposes[^3], rather than for the benefit of its members or shareholders. In other words, a public benefit corporation cannot distribute profits to its members or shareholders, but must instead use its funds to further its charitable mission.
