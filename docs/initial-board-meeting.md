# Initial board meeting

## Overview

Once the articles of incorporation and bylaws were drafted, the initial board meeting was scheduled to approve the documents and take the necessary steps to establish the organization. The initial board meeting is an important step in the process of forming a nonprofit organization, as it is the first official meeting of the board of directors and sets the tone for how the organization will operate moving forward. The meeting is an opportunity for the board to review and approve the organization's governing documents, elect officers, and take any other necessary actions to establish the organization. Once again, the template provided by Public Counsel was invaluable in preparing for the initial board meeting. The template included a sample agenda, minutes, and resolutions that covered all of the key items that needed to be addressed at the meeting.

Drafting the organizational documents and then having the board review and approve them ensured that everyone in the organization was on the same page about the purpose, structure, and operations of the organization before beginning the process of applying for 501c3 status with the IRS. All the organizational documents, minutes and agenda were organized in the organization's Google Drive folder for easy access by the board members and other stakeholders.
