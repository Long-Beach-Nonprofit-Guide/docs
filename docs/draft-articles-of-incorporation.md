# Draft articles of incorporation

Articles of incorporation are legal documents that establish a corporation as a legal entity. They are filed with the state in which the corporation is formed and contain important information about the corporation, such as its name, purpose, and structure. Drafting articles of incorporation is an essential step in the process of forming a nonprofit organization, as they are required to obtain 501c3 status from the IRS.

## Why are articles of incorporation important?

Articles of incorporation are important for several reasons:

1. **Establish legal status:** Articles of incorporation establish a corporation as a legal entity separate from its founders and members. This legal status provides protection for the organization's founders and members and allows the organization to enter into contracts, own property, and conduct business in its own name.

2. **Define the organization's purpose:** Articles of incorporation define the purpose and activities of the organization. This information is important for obtaining 501c3 status from the IRS and for ensuring that the organization operates in accordance with its mission and goals.

3. **Outline the organization's structure:** Articles of incorporation outline the structure of the organization, including the roles and responsibilities of its officers, directors, and members. This information is important for establishing clear lines of authority and accountability within the organization.

4. **Provide a legal framework:** Articles of incorporation provide a legal framework for the organization's operations. They establish the rules and regulations that govern the organization's activities and provide a basis for resolving disputes and conflicts among its members.

5. **Facilitate fundraising:** Articles of incorporation are often required by funders and donors as part of the grant application process. Having well-drafted articles of incorporation can help build credibility with funders and donors and demonstrate that the organization is well-governed and accountable.

## How to draft articles of incorporation for your organization

Drafting articles of incorporation for your organization involves several key steps:

1. **Choose a name for your organization:** The first step in drafting articles of incorporation is to choose a name for your organization. The name you choose should be unique, easy to remember, and reflective of your organization's mission and purpose. You should also check to make sure that the name is available and not already in use by another organization.

2. **Define the purpose of your organization:** Define the purpose and activities of your organization in clear and concise terms. Your articles of incorporation should clearly state the mission and goals of the organization and outline the activities it will engage in to achieve those goals.

3. **Outline the structure of your organization:** Outline the structure of your organization, including the roles and responsibilities of its officers, directors, and members. Your articles of incorporation should specify how the organization will be governed, how decisions will be made, and how conflicts will be resolved.

4. **Include required legal language:** Articles of incorporation must include certain legal language required by the state in which the organization is formed. This language typically includes the name of the organization, its purpose, its duration, and other key information required by state law.

5. **File the articles of incorporation:** Once you have drafted the articles of incorporation, you will need to file them with the state in which the organization is formed. This typically involves submitting the articles of incorporation to the state's business registration office along with a filing fee. Once the articles of incorporation are filed, the organization will be legally established as a corporation.

## Conclusion

Drafting articles of incorporation is an essential step in the process of forming a nonprofit organization. Articles of incorporation establish the organization as a legal entity, define its purpose and structure, and provide a legal framework for its operations. By following the steps outlined above, you can draft articles of incorporation that meet the legal requirements of your state and help establish a strong foundation for your organization's future success. With well-drafted articles of incorporation, you can obtain 501c3 status from the IRS, build credibility with funders and donors, and ensure that your organization operates in accordance with its mission and goals.
