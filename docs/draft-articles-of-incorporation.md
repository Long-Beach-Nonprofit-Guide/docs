# Draft articles of incorporation

Articles of incorporation are legal documents that establish a corporation as a legal entity. They are filed with the state in which the corporation is formed and contain important information about the corporation, such as its name, purpose, and structure. Drafting articles of incorporation is an essential step in the process of forming a nonprofit organization, as they are required to obtain 501c3 status from the IRS.

I found separating the process of drafting articles of incorporation from the process of filing them with the state to be helpful. This way, I could focus on getting the content right before worrying about the formatting and filing requirements. Furthermore, it allowed me to get feedback from others during the initial board meeting before finalizing the articles for filing.

## Why are articles of incorporation important?

Articles of incorporation are important for several reasons:

1. **Establish legal status:** Articles of incorporation establish a corporation as a legal entity separate from its founders and members. This legal status provides protection for the organization's founders and members and allows the organization to enter into contracts, own property, and conduct business in its own name.

1. **Define the organization's purpose:** Articles of incorporation define the purpose and activities of the organization. This information is important for obtaining 501c3 status from the IRS and for ensuring that the organization operates in accordance with its mission and goals.
