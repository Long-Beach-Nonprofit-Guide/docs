# Draft articles of incorporation

## Overview

Once I had the name, domain name, and digital infrastructure in place, the next step was to draft the articles of incorporation. The articles of incorporation are the legal document that establishes the existence of the corporation. They are filed with the California Secretary of State and contain basic information about the organization, such as its name, purpose, and initial board of directors. One of the key requirements for the articles of incorporation is specifying an Agent for Service of Process, which is the person or entity that will receive legal documents on behalf of the corporation. It is important to choose an Agent for Service of Process who is reliable and can be reached at a physical address during normal business hours. Given that the articles of incorporation are a public document, it is also important to consider privacy concerns when choosing an Agent for Service of Process since their name and address will be publicly available.

Due to these considerations, I wanted to first draft the articles of incorporation so that the board could then review and approve them at the initial board meeting. This would ensure that the board was in agreement on the key provisions of the articles of incorporation before they were filed with the California Secretary of State.
