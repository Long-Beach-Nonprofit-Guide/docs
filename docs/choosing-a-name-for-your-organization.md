# Choosing a name for your organization

Choosing a name for your organization is an important step in establishing your nonprofit. Your organization's name is the first thing people will see and hear, and it can have a significant impact on how your organization is perceived. A well-chosen name can help you attract donors, volunteers, and supporters, while a poorly chosen name can make it difficult for people to understand what your organization does or why it is important.

## Why is choosing a name important?

Choosing a name for your organization is important for several reasons:

1. **Communicates your mission:** Your organization's name should reflect its mission and purpose. A well-chosen name can help communicate what your organization stands for and what you are trying to achieve.

2. **Attracts donors and supporters:** A name that is clear, compelling, and easy to remember can help attract donors, volunteers, and supporters to your cause. It can make your organization more memorable and help you stand out from other organizations in the same space.

3. **Establishes credibility:** A professional-sounding name can help establish credibility and trust with donors, volunteers, and the community. It can make your organization appear more legitimate and professional, which can help build confidence in your organization.

4. **Differentiates your organization:** A unique name can help differentiate your organization from others in the same space. It can help you stand out and make it easier for people to remember and recognize your organization.

## How to choose a name for your organization

Choosing a name for your organization involves several key steps:

1. **Define your organization's mission:** Start by defining your organization's mission and purpose. What problem are you trying to solve? What impact do you want to have on the community or the world? Your organization's name should reflect these goals and objectives.

2. **Consider your target audience:** Think about who your organization serves and who your key stakeholders are. Your organization's name should resonate with your target audience and communicate why your organization is important to them.

3. **Brainstorm ideas:** Brainstorm a list of potential names for your organization. Consider names that reflect your mission, are easy to remember, and are unique. Avoid names that are too long, difficult to pronounce, or similar to other organizations in your space.

4. **Check availability:** Once you have a list of potential names, check to see if they are available. You can do this by searching online, checking with your state's business registry, and consulting with legal counsel. Make sure that the name you choose is not already in use by another organization and that it is not trademarked.

5. **Get feedback:** Once you have narrowed down your list of potential names, get feedback from your team, volunteers, and stakeholders. Ask them what they think of the names and whether they accurately reflect your organization's mission and purpose.

6. **Finalize your name:** Once you have received feedback and made any necessary revisions, finalize your organization's name. Make sure that everyone in your organization is aligned with the name and understands its significance.

7. **Register your name:** Once you have chosen a name for your organization, you should reserve it with the California Secretary of State's office. This will prevent other organizations from using the same name and will give you exclusive rights to use the name in California. You can reserve your organization's name by filing a Name Reservation Request form with the Secretary of State's office and paying a small fee. This will give you 60 days to file your organization's articles of incorporation and officially establish your nonprofit.
