# Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for 501c3 status, an organization must meet the following requirements:

1. **Organizational Test:** The organization must be organized and operated exclusively for one or more exempt purposes, such as charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and preventing cruelty to children or animals.
1. **Operational Test:** The organization must operate exclusively for one or more exempt purposes. This means that the organization's activities must further its exempt purposes and not be for the benefit of private interests.
1. **Public Support Test:** The organization must receive a substantial portion of its support from the general public or from governmental units. This test is used to determine whether the organization is a public charity or a private foundation.
1. **Political Activity Test:** The organization must not engage in political activities, such as lobbying or campaigning for political candidates. However, the organization may engage in some lobbying activities as long as they are not a substantial part of its activities.
1. **Private Benefit Test:** The organization must not provide more than an insubstantial amount of its benefits to private interests. This means that the organization's activities must primarily benefit the public rather than private individuals or organizations.
1. **Asset Transfer Test:** The organization must agree to distribute its assets to another tax-exempt organization upon dissolution. This ensures that the organization's assets are used for charitable purposes in the event that it ceases to exist.

If an organization meets these requirements, it may be eligible for 501c3 status with the IRS. However, meeting these requirements does not guarantee approval of tax-exempt status, as the IRS will review the organization's application and determine whether it meets all of the necessary criteria.
