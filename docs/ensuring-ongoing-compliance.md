# Ensuring ongoing compliance

Once your organization has obtained 501c3 status, it is important to ensure ongoing compliance with the requirements set forth by the IRS. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in penalties, fines, or even revocation of your organization's tax-exempt status. This section will provide an overview of the key compliance requirements that your organization must adhere to in order to maintain its 501c3 status.

## Why is ongoing compliance important?

Ongoing compliance is important for several reasons:

1. **Maintaining tax-exempt status:** In order to maintain your organization's 501c3 status, you must comply with the rules and regulations set forth by the IRS. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in the loss of your organization's tax-exempt status, which can have serious financial and legal consequences.

2. **Avoiding penalties and fines:** Noncompliance with IRS requirements can result in penalties, fines, or other sanctions. These penalties can be costly and can impact your organization's ability to carry out its mission and programs.

3. **Ensuring transparency and accountability:** Compliance with IRS requirements helps ensure that your organization operates in a transparent and accountable manner. By following the rules and regulations set forth by the IRS, you can build trust with donors, volunteers, and other stakeholders.

4. **Protecting your organization's reputation:** Maintaining ongoing compliance with IRS requirements can help protect your organization's reputation and credibility. By demonstrating that your organization is well-governed and accountable, you can attract support from donors, funders, and the community.

## Key compliance requirements

In order to maintain your organization's 501c3 status, you must adhere to the following key compliance requirements:

1. **Annual reporting:** Your organization must file an annual information return (Form 990, Form 990-EZ, or Form 990-N) with the IRS. The type of form you are required to file depends on the size and activities of your organization. Failure to file an annual information return can result in penalties and fines.

2. **Maintaining records:** Your organization must maintain accurate and complete records of its activities, finances, and governance. These records should be kept for a minimum of three years and should be made available to the IRS upon request.

3. **Avoiding prohibited activities:** Your organization must avoid engaging in certain prohibited activities, such as engaging in excessive lobbying or political activities. Failure to comply with these restrictions can result in the loss of your organization's tax-exempt status.

4. **Public disclosure:** Your organization must make certain information available to the public, such as its annual information return and exemption application. This information should be made available upon request and on your organization's website, if applicable.

5. **Conflict of interest policy:** Your organization must adopt and adhere to a conflict of interest policy that outlines how conflicts of interest will be identified and managed. This policy should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it remains effective.

By adhering to these key compliance requirements, your organization can maintain its 501c3 status and continue to carry out its mission and programs in a transparent and accountable manner.
