## Overview

Welcome to the Long Beach Nonprofit Guide! This guide details the steps that I took to establish a 501c3 nonprofit organization in Long Beach, California. The organization characteristics made the process relatively straightforward in that it was organized as a charitable organization public benefit corporation, there were no members, no employees, and no physical assets. That being said, the process of taking an unincorporated group of individuals and turning it into a legally recognized nonprofit organization was still complex and time-consuming. This guide is intended to document the steps that I took in the hopes that it will be helpful to others who are considering starting similar nonprofit organization in Long Beach or elsewhere.

## How this guide is organized

This guide represents the step-by-step process that I took to not only establish a 501c3 nonprofit organization, but also to establish the necessary infrastructure to make the organization operational. Each step in the process is documented in a separate document, which is linked in the table of contents below. The order of the steps was influenced by the filing requirements of the IRS and California state agencies, as well as some of the practical considerations that I encountered along the way that ensured that the organization was set up for success.

Each step section includes a brief overview of the task, a list of resources, a description of the process that I followed, the outcomes of the completed task and a cost breakdown. In some cases, I have included links to external resources that I found helpful in completing the task. I have also included some tips and recommendations based on my experience, as well as some potential pitfalls to avoid.
