# Choosing a name

It is important to choose a name for your nonprofit organization **before** you start the process of establishing it. The name you choose will be an important part of your organization's identity and will be used in all of your communications and branding efforts. You should check both at the state and federal level to ensure that the name you choose is not already in use by another organization. You can use the following resources to check the availability of a name:

- **California Secretary of State:** You can search the California Secretary of State's business entity database to see if the name you want is already in use by another organization. You can search the database [here](https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/search/business).

- **IRS Tax Exempt Organization Search:** You can search the IRS's Tax Exempt Organization Search to see if the name you want is already in use by another tax-exempt organization. You can search the database [here](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/search-for-tax-exempt-organizations).

Once you have chosen a name that is not already in use, you should consider reserving it with the California Secretary of State to ensure that no one else can use it while you are in the process of establishing your organization. You can reserve a name by filing a Name Reservation Request form with the California Secretary of State. The process for reserving a name is outlined on the California Secretary of State's website [here](https://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/business-entities/name-reservations).

When choosing a name for your organization, you should consider the following tips:

- **Make it unique:** Choose a name that is distinct and memorable. Avoid generic names that could be confused with other organizations.

- **Make it descriptive:** Choose a name that reflects the mission and purpose of your organization. A descriptive name can help potential donors and supporters understand what your organization does.

- **Make it easy to spell and pronounce:** Choose a name that is easy to spell and pronounce. This will make it easier for people to remember and search for your organization.
